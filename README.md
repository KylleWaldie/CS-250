# CS-250

  When talking to the user and interpreting their needs it is best to write down notes and constantly ask question in case you are confused and need clarification. Also checking up on the customer from time to time and letting them know what is going on during the development stage of the program and checking to make sure that everything is going as planned and that they do not have any chnages. 
  
  The aproach that I take when developing programs is to break them into smaller pieces and work on them one function at a time. I also like to have a rough plan of what i need for the program from the start to make sure that i can keep a nice continuous work flow instead of constantly thinking what i need to do next. The agile process that i plan on implimenting is the sprints. If i am working on a larger project i would like to plan out what i want to get done during that week. Or if it is a smaller project i would even plan out what i needed to acomplish that day. That just gives me a goal to work towards and strive for.

    To be a good team member is to always get done what you said you would get done suring a scrum meeting. Being prompt and on time are also really important for being a good team member. You do not want your team members to be waiting for you or if you know that you are going to be late do not make a habit out of it and let them know in advance.
