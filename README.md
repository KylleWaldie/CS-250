# CS-250

  When talking to the user and interpreting their needs it is best to write down notes and constantly ask questions in case you are confused and need clarification. Also, check up on the customer from time to time and let them know what is going on during the development stage of the program and check to make sure that everything is going as planned and that they do not have any changes. 
  
  The approach that I take when developing programs is to break them into smaller pieces and work on them one function at a time. I also like to have a rough plan of what I need for the program from the start to make sure that I can keep a nice continuous workflow instead of constantly thinking about what I need to do next. The agile process that I plan on implementing is sprints. If I am working on a larger project I would like to plan out what I want to get done during that week. Or if it is a smaller project I would even plan out what I needed to accomplish that day. That just gives me a goal to work towards and strive for.

  To be a good team member is to always get what you said you would get done during a scrum meeting. Being prompt and on time are also really important for being a good team member. You do not want your team members to be waiting for you or if you know that you are going to be late do not make a habit out of it and let them know in advance.
